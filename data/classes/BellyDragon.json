    "Notes": "A long dragon boss. It features six weak spots that have to be popped using the player's attacks. It always spawns a Power Star. It uses a GeneralPos with the name プレイヤーデモ位置（ベリードラゴン戦） to position the player during the intro. If it's part of a cutscene, it also creates cutscene objects for KoopaJr and KoopaJrPod. See BellyDragonLv1Zone for a better look inside the cutscene.",
